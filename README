This folder must be located in a folder containing the Althea projects being tested together:

```
althea-mesh/
  |- integration-tests/   # This folder
  |- rita/                # Rita metering daemon
  |- babeld/              # Althea fork of babeld
```

The tests need to be run on ubuntu 16.04 as root (`sudo su`).

Network lab needs to be installed using `bpkg`.

Example:
```
sudo su
bpkg install sudomesh/network-lab

bash rita.sh
```
